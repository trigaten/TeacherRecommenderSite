                    The system works in a few steps. First, you, as the college counselor enter the emails
                    of the students and teachers who will be writing recommendations. To make this a bit
                    easier, you can add student email Groups and also remove certain emails if that student
                    no longer attends your school.

                    Then, you can automatically create and send Google Forms, first to students, then to teachers.
                    The student forms will ask students to rank 6 pairs of teacher reccomenders.
                    The teacher form will ask teachers to consider how strongly they feel they can write
                    reccomendations for the students who listed them.

                    After the results have been collected you can run an algorithm which goes along the lists of data
                    and finds the student/teacher matchess which have the highest scores.
                    You can review these pairings, make any changes you would like, and automatically send assignments
                    and pairings to teachers and students.
